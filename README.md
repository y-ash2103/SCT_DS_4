🚦 Road Traffic Accident (RTA) Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview
    This project focuses on analyzing road traffic accident (RTA) data to uncover key insights about accident severity, driver characteristics, vehicle conditions, and 
    environmental factors. The goal is to identify the major causes of severe/fatal accidents and provide a data-driven foundation for improving road safety policies.

📂 Project Components
    Dataset: RTA.csv containing real-world accident records.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Accident severity distribution
    Driver demographics (age, gender, education, experience)
    Vehicle and road conditions
    Casualty patterns across different severities
    Visualization: Clear and interactive plots for better insights.
    Notebook: book_1.ipynb documents the entire analysis pipeline step by step.

🎯 Objectives
    Understand patterns in accident severity.
    Explore the role of driver and vehicle factors.
    Identify high-risk conditions and accident-prone scenarios.
    Provide insights that can support traffic management and safety initiatives.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
    Python 🐍
    Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
    Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
    Jupyter Notebook for analysis

📊 Outcomes
    Data-driven insights into accident severity factors.
    Visual evidence highlighting the impact of human, vehicle, and environmental elements.
    Foundation for predictive modeling of accident severity (future scope).
